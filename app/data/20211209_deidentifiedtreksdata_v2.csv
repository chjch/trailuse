There is nothing principally wrong with any of the above, but how individuals and groups employ these mobility assists causes extreme trail conflicts and enmity between user groups. Typically, equestrians try to parcel off access to certain areas and mountain bikers will use speed and intimidation to discourage hiking and other trail activities. It also doesn’t help that in most cases mobility assist user groups don’t have to pay any subsidy to maintain trails/forest ecology despite doing more damage than people on foot and being able to afford tens of thousands in upfront costs for bikes/horses.

Mountain bikers were stigmatized for a long time and have become sectarian as a result. A lot of negative energy creeps into sectarian user groups (not just mountain bikers) and about the only thing that makes sense after awhile is going back to how you got started enjoying the outdoors in the first place; solo. Even if it weren’t for discrimination from other user groups against mountain bikers and the sectarian tendencies there’s an industry problem where everyone from Redbull, to bike manufacturers, to Strava encourages a style of riding that is dangerous, noninclusive, and ultra competitive. I can’t begin to recall how many group rides I led where the tug of war between the Darwinists off the front and the recreating cyclists off the back kept us all split up and regrouping constantly. When you stop trying to lead and step outside that paradigm for awhile it becomes clear how there’s a toxicity that slowly creeps into you and other riders because of inside/outside forces trying to lead us all away from the simple pleasures of riding a bicycle.
